# react-stripe

üí≥. stripe payment gateway react component. Do give it a try for your projects. For better experience of data flow, i have integrated firebase firestore to perform CRUD on stripe payment transaction.

## How it works !

## Data flow

* Use Proceeds to checkout after product selection (asumption, customer is already in his/her cart page and processing checkout)
* stripe comes into action - takes user information such as email, shipping and billing details and card details
* stipe-api
  * once user presses checkout button, stripe gets use details and performs checkout process at stripe end such as create new user, create charge (everything related to payment i.e. credit card verification, payment processing etc.)
  * Once stripe is is done with its internal processing, it sends response to be received by react front end. This response can be either error (failure of payment, integration set up etc.) or payment data in case of success. Note that react front-end does not store users credit card details.
* upon success response from stripe, react front-end de-structures required input data from stripe response and sends to firebase firestore. Here, you can store bunch of data however, in this project for the sack of demonstration, i have pulled basic user inforamation i.e. name, email, billing address and product details.
* firebase firestore is integrated with react front-end in realtime and transactions are seamless.

Hope i have explained at least basisc of payment processing to some extent. if you have any query, let me know. Happy coding ‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚ò∫Ô∏è


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
